# 👋 Who's Julien Sacko and What Is He Building?

Hi, I'm **Julien Sacko**, a **Machine Learning Engineer** passionate about building robust, scalable, and production-ready ML systems for end users. I specialize in **Natural Language Processing**, **data analysis** and **MLOps practices** to take projects from raw data to real-world deployment.

🔍 I love exploring how **AI can empower users**, drive **business value**, and scale seamlessly through automation and cloud-native tools.

### 🚀 What I Do

- 📊 **Data Analysis & Feature Engineering** using `pandas`, `numpy`, and `seaborn`
- 🤖 **Model Training** with `TensorFlow`, `PyTorch` and `scikit-learn`,
- 💡**LLMs & Deep Learning**: `Fine-tuning` LLMs from `HuggingFace` with PyTorch and `LoRA`, building neural networks, transfer learning, and advanced NLP model architectures
- ⚙️ **MLOps & Production** with `Airflow`, `MLflow`, `Weights & Biases`, `DVC`, `FastAPI`, and `BentoML`
- 🐳 **Cloud Containerization & Deployment** using `Docker`, `Azure ML` and `AWS`
- 📈 **Monitoring & Observability** via `Prometheus` and `Grafana`
