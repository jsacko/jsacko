### 📚 Projects

Welcome to my portfolio, where i showcase my projects

# Machine Learning

| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| 💬 [Kaggle Text Classification](https://github.com/jsacko/Text-Classification-Kaggle-Competition-2025) | October 2025 | Python, PyTorch, HuggingFace, TensorFlow | Developed and fine-tuned state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) using HuggingFace Transformers, TensorFlow, and PyTorch for text classification tasks. The project encompassed data preprocessing, training optimization, and distributed inference, achieving 0.88 AUC on the public leaderboard. Implemented advanced data visualization and bias detection techniques to address class imbalance and ensure fairness in model predictions. |
| 🎮 [Esport prediction](https://github.com/jsacko/LoL-predict) | June 2025 | Python, Azure ML, Scikit-learn, Pandas, PostgreSQL, Docker, Apache Airflow, MLFlow, FastAPI, Prometheus, Grafana | Designed and deployed a complete machine learning pipeline to predict professional League of Legends esports match outcomes. The pipeline encompassed data extraction, feature engineering, and model training using Python and Scikit-learn, followed by containerized deployment for real-time inference and monitoring. Achieved 67% prediction accuracy, demonstrating the pipeline’s capability to process live data streams and deliver actionable, data-driven insights. |
